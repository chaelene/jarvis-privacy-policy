# Jarvis Companion Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 22, 2025**

Jarvis Companion ("the Skill") is a fan-inspired Alexa skill for voice-controlled camera scans, security checks, and AI-generated jokes. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information. "We," "us," or "our" refers to the developer of this unofficial fan project.

## Information We Collect
- **No Personal Data**: The Skill does not collect, store, or transmit personal information (e.g., name, email, location, or voice recordings). All interactions are processed locally on your device or via secure, anonymized third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI or xAI for AI responses).
- **Voice Commands**: Transcriptions are handled by Amazon Alexa and not retained by us.
- **Camera Data**: Smart camera feeds (e.g., TP-Link Tapo C200) are accessed locally via RTSP—no uploads or sharing.
- **Device Info**: Minimal anonymous usage data (e.g., command types) may be logged for debugging, but nothing identifiable.

## How We Use Information
- Processed in real-time for skill functionality (e.g., "scan the room" triggers camera pan).
- No sharing with third parties except secure API providers (who have their own policies: see OpenAI/xAI terms).

## Your Rights
- Access/Delete: No data stored, so N/A.
- Changes: We'll update this policy for major changes and notify via skill updates.
- Contact: For questions, email [your-email@example.com].

We comply with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). No affiliation with Amazon, Marvel, Disney, or API providers—this is an unofficial fan project.
